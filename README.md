# InventorySystem_PHP

The Inventory Management System In PHP is a simple project developed using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. The project contains an admin and user side. The admin side manages all the management like editing site contents, managing orders, products, categories, and also managing users. The admin has the main role in the management of this system.

For the user side, the users can go through the dashboard and manage orders. In order to login as an user, the user has to login with the correct username and password.
